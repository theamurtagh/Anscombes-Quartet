The dataset was created in the 1970's by Francis Anscombe, an English statistican. The Dataset comprises of four sets of data that appear very similar to each other when looked at in a tabular form and observing the main summaries from this. <br>

#### **Table of Anscombes Quartet**

When the datasets are plotted however a very different understanding is achieved. Each dataset presents a very diffent description in visual form, despite the numers proximity to each other. Anscombe wanted to emphasise the importance of visualising data first.
Personally coming from a fine art background, i found this really interseting, as its about the signifigence of visualisiation , how an image can in a instant show to the user the variance, complexity etc of a concept.

- Dataset I <br>
- Dataset II <br>
- Dataset III <br>
- Dataset IV  

An post in heapanalytics.com discussed the relevance of the dataset in terms of being cautious with summary statistics and an over reliance on these. While useful it can be the detriment of anyone to over rely and accept these and to illustrate the point Anscombes Dataset was referenced and discussed.
